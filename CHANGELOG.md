## [0.2.5] - 2022-06-02
### Improved
- Integrated ``pre-commit`` with the following hooks:
  - id: trailing-whitespace
  - id: end-of-file-fixer
  - id: check-yaml
  - id: check-added-large-files
  - id: black
  - id: flake8
  - id: isort
- Updated dependencies (tested with pandas v1.4.2 and plotly v5.8.0).

## [0.2.4] - 2022-01-22
### Improved
- Updated extra dependencies.

## [0.2.3] - 2022-01-04
### Added
- Input argument ``**layout_kwargs`` added to ``plot_dataframe`` function.
  This allows the user to make use of ``plotly``'s vast layout settings via passing through ``plotly`` related keyword arguments.
  Further information can be found at https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.graph_objects.Layout.html.

## [0.2.2] - 2021-11-28
### Added
- Input argument ``plotly_renderer`` added in order to select the appropriate renderer.
For more information about ``plotly``'s renderers, visit the respective website at https://plotly.com/python/renderers/.
- Extensive documentation now available at https://df2img.dev.

## [0.2.1] - 2021-11-13
### Added
- Possibility to hide the header row.
  Added input argument ``tbl_header_visible`` to the ``plot_dataframe`` function, which controls the behavior. If set to `False`, the table header will be invisible. ``tbl_header_visible`` takes precedence over ``tbl_header`` input argument. That is, if you set it to `False`, it doesn't matter whether you provide the ``tbl_header`` argument.

## [0.2.0] - 2021-10-26
### Added
- Possibility to set alignment for individual columns
  ([GH #2](https://github.com/andreas-vester/df2img/issues/2)).
- Possibility to set relative column widths ([GH #3](https://github.com/andreas-vester/df2img/issues/3)).

### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGES**: Changed the backend from ``matplotlib`` to ``plotly``. As a result, function names and signature completely changed.
- Possibility to set various title formats/styles.
- Possibility to set various table header row formats/styles.
- Possibility to set various table cell formats/styles.
- Possibility to set figure size.

### Removed
- Function ``df2img``.
  Has been replaced with ``plot_dataframe`` and ``save_dataframe``.

## [0.1.1] - 2021-10-02
### Fixed
- Input arguments ``col_width``, ``row_height``, and ``font_size`` now accept ``int`` ([GH issue #1](https://github.com/andreas-vester/df2img/issues/1)).

## [0.1.0] - 2021-09-17
### Added
- Possibility to save ``pd.DataFrame`` into image file (e.g. png or jpg).
- Possibility to add title to the image.
- Possibility to define the number of header rows and header columns.
- Possibility to change colors for header rows.
- Possibility to alternate row colors for better readability.
- Possibility to change column width and row height.
- Possibility to change font size.
